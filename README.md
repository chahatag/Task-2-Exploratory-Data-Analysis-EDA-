This project performs Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on the Titanic dataset to understand feature distributions, detect patterns, and prepare data for modeling.

**Visualizations**
   - Histograms and boxplots for `Age`, `Fare`, `SibSp`, `Parch`.
   - Correlation matrix and pairplot to explore relationships.

**Insights**
   - Most passengers were aged 20â€“40.
   - Fare is right-skewed with high outliers.
   - Female passengers and higher-class tickets had better survival chances (visually observed).

## Tools Used
- Python, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn
